# Classic portal: Set Microsoft Defender for Identity notifications

[!INCLUDE [automatic-redirect](../includes/automatic-redirect.md)]


Microsoft Defender for Identity can notify you when it detects a suspicious activity and issues a security alert or a health alert via email.

To receive notifications to a specific email address, set the following parameters:

1. In the Defender for Identity portal, select the settings option on the toolbar and select **Configuration**.

1. Click **Notifications**.
1. Under **Mail notifications**, add email addresses for the notifications you want to receive - they can be sent for new alerts (suspicious activities) and new health issues.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Emails are only sent for notifications with defined email addresses.
    > - Email alerts for suspicious activities are only sent when the suspicious activity is created.

1. Click **Save**.

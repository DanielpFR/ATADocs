# Security assessment: Remove non-admin accounts with DCSync permissions

## Why might the DCSync permission be a risk?

Accounts with the DCSync permission can initiate domain replication, which can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, manipulate domain data, or compromise the integrity and availability of your Active Directory environment.

It's crucial to carefully manage and restrict the membership of this group to ensure the security and integrity of your domain replication process.

## How do I use this security assessment to improve my organizational security posture?

1. Review the recommended action at <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions> for **Remove non-admin accounts with DCSync permissions**.

    For example:

1. Review this list of exposed entities to discover which of your accounts have DCSync permissions and are also non-domain admins.

1. Take appropriate action on those entities by removing their privileged access rights.

To achieve the maximum score, remediate all exposed entities.

> [!NOTE]
> This assessment is updated in near real time.
> The reports show the affected entities from the last 30 days. After that time, entities no longer affected will be removed from the exposed entities list.

# Security assessment: Remove access rights on suspicious accounts with the Admin SDHolder permission

This article describes the **Remove access rights on suspicious accounts with the Admin SDHolder permission** security assessment, which highlights risky access rights on suspicious accounts.

## Why might the Admin SDHolder permission be risky?

Having non-sensitive accounts with **Admin SDHolder** (security descriptor holder) permissions can have significant security implications, including:

- Leading to unauthorized privilege escalation, where attackers can exploit these accounts to gain administrative access and compromise sensitive systems or data
- Increasing the attack surface, making it harder to track and mitigate security incidents, potentially exposing the organization to greater risks.

## How do I use this security assessment to improve my organizational security posture?

1. Review the recommended action at <https://security.microsoft.com/securescore?viewid=actions> for **Remove access rights on suspicious accounts with the Admin SDHolder permission**.

    For example:

1. Review the list of exposed entities to discover which of your non-sensitive accounts have the **Admin SDHolder** permission.

1. Take appropriate action on those entities by removing their privileged access rights.
 
To achieve the full score, remediate all exposed entities.

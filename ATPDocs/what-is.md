# What is Microsoft Defender for Identity?

Microsoft Defender for Identity is a cloud-based security solution that uses your on-premises Active Directory signals to enhance security monitoring across your organization. Defender for Identity is fully integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender, and helps you identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

Deploy Defender for Identity to help your SecOp analysts and security professionals detect advanced attacks in hybrid environments, including:

- **Monitoring users, entity behavior, and activities** with learning-based analytics
- **Protecting user identities and credentials** stored in Active Directory
- **Identifying and investigating** suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain
- **Providing clear incident information** on a simple timeline for fast triage

Defender for Identity was formerly known as Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP).

## Monitor and analyze user behavior and activities

Defender for Identity monitors and analyzes user activities and information across your network, creating a behavioral baseline for each user. For example, user activities and information might include specific permissions and group membership.

Defender for Identity then identifies anomalies with adaptive built-in intelligence and provides insights into suspicious activities and events. Defender for Identity compares activities with your baseline data to reveal the advanced threats, compromised users, and insider threats facing your organization.

Defender for Identity's proprietary sensors monitor organizational domain controllers, providing a comprehensive view for all user activities from every device.

## Protect user identities and reduce the attack surface

Defender for Identity provides you with invaluable insights on identity configurations and suggested security best-practices. Through security reports and user profile analytics, Defender for Identity helps dramatically reduce your organizational attack surface, making it harder to compromise user credentials, and advance an attack.

For example:

- **Defender for Identity's *Lateral Movement Paths*** help you quickly understand exactly how an attacker can move laterally inside your organization. [Lateral movement paths](understand-lateral-movement-paths.md) can compromise sensitive accounts, and Defender for Identity helps you prevent those risks in advance.

- **[Defender for Identity security assessments](security-assessment.md)**, available from [Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score), provide extra insights to improve your organizational security posture and policies.

## Protect AD FS in hybrid environments

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) plays an important role in today's infrastructure when it comes to authentication in hybrid environments.

Defender for Identity protects your AD FS by detecting on-premises attacks on AD FS and providing visibility into authentication events generated by AD FS.

Deploying Defender for Identity with AD FS requires extra deployment steps. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity on Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)](active-directory-federation-services.md).

## Identify suspicious activities and advanced attacks across the cyber-attack kill-chain

Typically, attacks are launched against any accessible entity, such as a low-privileged user. Attackers then quickly move laterally until they gain access to valuable assets, such as sensitive accounts, domain administrators, and highly sensitive data.

Defender for Identity identifies these advanced threats at the source throughout the entire cyber-attack kill chain:

|Threat  |In Defender for Identity ...  |
|---------|---------|
|**Reconnaissance**     |     Identify rogue users and attackers' attempts to gain information. <br><br>Attackers search for information about user names, users' group membership, IP addresses assigned to devices, resources, and more, using various methods.    |
|**Compromised credentials**     |   Identify attempts to compromise user credentials using brute force attacks, failed authentications, user group membership changes, and other methods.      |
|**Lateral movements**     |  Detect attempts to move laterally inside the network to gain further control of sensitive users, utilizing methods such as Pass the Ticket, Pass the Hash, Overpass the Hash and more.       |
|**Domain dominance**     |   View highlighted attacker behavior if domain dominance is achieved. For example, attackers might run code remotely on the domain controller, or use methods like DC Shadow, malicious domain controller replication, Golden Ticket activities, and more.      |


## Investigate alerts and user activities

Defender for Identity is designed to reduce general alert noise, providing only relevant, important security alerts in a simple, real-time organizational attack timeline. 

The Defender for Identity attack timeline view allows you to easily stay focused on what matters, using the intelligence of smart analytics. Use Defender for Identity to quickly investigate threats, and gain insights across the organization for users, devices, and network resources.

Seamless integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides another layer of enhanced security by extra detection and protection against advanced persistent threats on the operating system.

### Security posture assessments for AD CS sensors (Preview)

Defender for Identity's security posture assessments proactively detect and recommend actions across your on-premises Active Directory configurations. 

Recommended actions now include the following new security posture assessments, specifically for certificate templates and certificate authorities.

- **Certificate templates recommended actions**:

   - [Prevent users to request a certificate valid for arbitrary users based on the certificate template (ESC1)](security-assessment-prevent-users-request-certificate.md)
   - [Edit overly permissive certificate template with privileged EKU (Any purpose EKU or No EKU) (ESC2)](security-assessment-edit-overly-permissive-template.md)

   - [Edit misconfigured Certificate Authority ACL (ESC7)](security-assessment-edit-misconfigured-ca-acl.md)
   - [Enforce encryption for RPC certificate enrollment interface (ESC8)](security-assessment-enforce-encryption-rpc.md)

The new assessments are available in Microsoft Secure Score, surfacing security issues and severe misconfigurations that pose risks to the entire organization, alongside detections. Your score is updated accordingly.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/secure-score/adcs-new-reports.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new AD CS security posture assessments.":::

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity's security posture assessments](security-assessment.md).

> [!NOTE]
> While *certificate template* assessments are available to all customers that have AD CS installed on their environment, *certificate authority* assessments are available only to customers who've installed a sensor on an AD CS server. For more information, see [New sensor type for Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](#new-sensor-type-for-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs).

### Identity timeline includes more than 30 days of data (Preview)

Defender for Identity is gradually rolling out extended data retentions on identity details to more than 30 days. 

The identity details page **Timeline** tab, which includes activities from Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, currently includes a minimum of 150 days and is growing. There might be some variation in data retention rates over the next few weeks.

To view activities and alerts on the identity timeline within a specific time frame, select the default **30 Days** and then select **Custom range**. Filtered data from more than 30 days ago is shown for a maximum of seven days at a time.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/custom-time-frame.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the custom time frame options." lightbox="media/whats-new/custom-time-frame.png":::

### Defender for Identity release 2.216

This version includes improvements and bug fixes for cloud services and the Defender for Identity sensor.

## September 2023

### Decreased number of alerts for Remote Code Execution Attempts

To better align Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts, we've updated the detection logic for the Defender for Identity [Remote code execution attempt](other-alerts.md#remote-code-execution-attempt-external-id-2019) detections. 

While this change results in a decreased number of *Remote code execution attempt* alerts, Defender for Identity continues to record the remote code execution activities. Customers can continue to build their own [advanced hunting queries](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview) and create [custom detection policies](/microsoft-365/security/defender/custom-detection-rules). 

### Alert sensitivity settings and learning period enhancements

Some Defender for Identity alerts wait for a *learning period* before alerts are triggered, while building a profile of patterns to use when distinguishing between legitimate and suspicious activities.

Defender for Identity now provides the following enhancements for the learning period experience:

- Administrators can now use the **Remove learning period** setting to configure the sensitivity used for specific alerts. Define the sensitivity as *Normal* to configure the **Remove learning period** setting as *Off* for the selected type of alert. 

- After deploying a new sensor in a new Defender for Identity workspace, the **Remove learning period** setting is automatically turned *On* for 30 days. When 30 days are complete, the **Remove learning period** setting is automatically turned *Off,* and alert sensitivity levels are returned to their default functionality.

   To have Defender for Identity use standard learning period functionality, where alerts aren't generated until the learning period is done, configure the **Remove learning periods** setting to *Off*.

If you'd previously updated the **Remove learning period** setting, your setting remains as you'd configured it.

For more information, see [Advanced settings](advanced-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Advanced Settings** page originally listed the *Account enumeration reconnaissance* alert under the **Remove learning period** options as configurable for sensitivity settings. This alert was removed from the list and is replaced by the *Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP)* alert. This user interface bug was fixed in November 2023.

### Defender for Identity release 2.215

This version includes improvements and bug fixes for cloud services and the Defender for Identity sensor.

### Defender for Identity reports moved to the main Reports area

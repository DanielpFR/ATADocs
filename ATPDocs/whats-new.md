## September 2023

### Alert learning period enhancements

Defender for Identity alert learning periods have been enhanced to provide more control over the learning period experience, including:

- Any new Defender for Identity workspace automatically has an alert learning period turned on for 30 days. When 30 days is complete, the learning period is automatically turned off and a health alert is triggered to notify administrators.

- Administrators can now configure the sensitivity used for specific alerts, and can also completely turn off learning for specific alerts. For example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-settings/learning-period.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a learning period turned on.":::

During the learning period, Defender for Identity learns about your network and builds a profile of your network's normal activity. Learning periods can be useful for updating your baseline algorithms, but can also result in a high volume of alerts, some of which may be triggered by legitimate activity.

For more information, see [Advanced settings](advanced-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you'd previously had the **Remove learning period** setting turned on, this setting is now reverted to the default and is turned off. In such cases, we recommend checking your settings and reconfiguring sensitivity as needed.

### Defender for Identity release 2.215

This version includes improvements and bug fixes for cloud services and the Defender for Identity sensor.

### Defender for Identity reports moved to the main Reports area

Now you can access Defender for Identity reports from Microsoft 365 Defender's main **Reports** area instead of the **Settings** area. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/reports-main-area.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Defender for Identity report access from the main Reports area.":::

For more information, see [Download and schedule Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft 365 Defender (Preview)](reports.md).

### Go hunt button for groups in Microsoft 365 Defender

Defender for Identity has added the **Go hunt** button for groups in Microsoft 365 Defender. Users can use the **Go hunt** button to query for group-related activities and alerts during an investigation.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/go-hunt-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Go hunt button on a group details pane.":::

### Performance enhancements

Defender for Identity has made internal improvements for latency, stability, and performance when transferring real-time events from Defender for Identity services to Microsoft 365 Defender. Customers should expect no delays in Defender for Identity data appearing in Microsoft 365 Defender, such as alerts or activities for advanced hunting.

As of July 6, 2023, customers using the classic Defender for Identity portal are automatically redirected to Microsoft 365 Defender, with no option to revert back to the classic portal.

For more information, see our [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender-blog/leveraging-the-convergence-of-microsoft-defender-for-identity-in/ba-p/3856321) and [Microsoft Defender for Identity in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-center-mdi).

Now you can download and schedule periodic Defender for Identity reports from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, creating parity in report functionality with the [classic Defender for Identity portal](classic-reports.md).

Download and schedule reports in Microsoft 365 Defender from the **Settings > Identities > Report management** page. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/report-management.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Report management page." lightbox="media/whats-new/report-management.png":::

For example, use this card to learn whether a specific user is able to bypass password requirements or has a password that never expires.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new/uac-flags.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the UAC flags card on a user details page.":::

For more information, see the [User-Account-Control attribute](/windows/win32/adschema/a-useraccountcontrol) documentation.

For more information, see [Investigate users in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-users).

### Alert tuning in Microsoft 365 Defender

Alert tuning, now available in Microsoft 365 Defender, allows you to adjust your alerts and optimize them. Alert tuning reduces false positives, allows your SOC teams to focus on high-priority alerts, and improves threat detection coverage across your system.

In Microsoft 365 Defender, create rule conditions based on evidence types, and then apply your rule on any rule type that matches your conditions. For more information, see [Tune an alert](/microsoft-365/security/defender/investigate-alerts#public-preview-tune-an-alert).

## April 2023

### Defender for Identity release 2.202

Released April 23, 2023

- New health alert for verifying that Directory Services Configuration Container Auditing is configured correctly, as described in the [health alerts page](health-alerts.md#auditing-on-the-configuration-container-is-not-enabled-as-required).
- New workspaces for AD tenants mapped to New Zealand are created in the Australia East region. For the most current list of regional deployment, see [Defender for Identity components](architecture.md#defender-for-identity-components).

## March 2023

### Defender for Identity release 2.201

Released March 27, 2023

- We're in the process of disabling the SAM-R honeytoken alert. While these types of accounts should never be accessed or queried, certain legacy systems may use these accounts as part of their regular operations. If this functionality is necessary for you, you can always create an advanced hunting query and use it as a custom detection. We're also reviewing the LDAP honeytoken alert over the coming weeks, but remains functional for now.

- We fixed detection logic issues in the [Directory Services Object Auditing health alert](health-alerts.md#directory-services-object-auditing-is-not-enabled-as-required) for non-English operating systems, and for Windows 2012 with Directory Services schemas earlier than version 87.

- We removed the prerequisite of configuring a Directory Services account for the sensors to start. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity Directory Service account recommendations](directory-service-accounts.md#number-of-dsa-entries).

- We no longer require logging 1644 events. If you have this registry setting enabled, you can remove it. For more information, see [Event ID 1644](configure-windows-event-collection.md#event-id-1644).

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.200

Released March 16, 2023

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

### Defender for Identity release 2.199

Released March 5, 2023

- Some exclusions for the **Honeytoken was queried via SAM-R** alert weren't functioning properly. In these instances, alerts were being triggered even for excluded entities. This error has now been fixed.

- **Updated NTLM protocol name for the Identity Advanced Hunting tables**: The old protocol name `Ntlm` is now listed as the new protocol name `NTLM` in Advanced Hunting Identity tables: IdentityLogonEvents, IdentityQueryEvents, IdentityDirectoryEvents.
If you're currently using the `Ntlm` protocol in case-sensitive format from the Identity event tables, you should change it to `NTLM`.

- Version includes improvements and bug fixes for internal sensor infrastructure.

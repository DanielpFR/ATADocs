# Weekly operational guide - Microsoft Defender for Identity

This article reviews the Microsoft Defender for Identity activities we recommend for your team on a weekly basis.

## Review Secure score recommendations

**Where**: In Microsoft Defender XDR, select **Secure score**.

**Persona**: Security and compliance administrators, SOC analysts

Microsoft Secure score recommendations are based on the Microsoft security recommendations that are most relevant to your organization. Secure score recommendations for Defender for Identity include monitoring for on-premises identities and identity infrastructure weak points.

To view Secure Score recommendations per product, in Microsoft Defender XDR, select **Secure score > Recommended actions**, and group the list by **Product**.

## Review and respond to emerging threats

**Where**: In Microsoft Defender XDR, select **Hunting > Advanced hunting**

**Persona**: Security and compliance administrators, SOC analysts

We recommend that you configure custom detections in Microsoft Defender XDR to monitor and respond to various events and system states, such as suspected breach activity and misconfigured endpoints.

Custom detection rules can automatically trigger both alerts and response actions, and are based on advanced hunting queries. Run your custom detection rules regularly to generate alerts and take relevant response actions.

# Configure SAM-R to enable lateral movement path detection in Microsoft Defender for Identity

Microsoft Defender for Identity mapping for [potential lateral movement paths](/defender-for-identity/understand-lateral-movement-paths) relies on queries that identify local admins on specific machines. These queries are performed with the SAM-R protocol, using the Defender for Identity [Directory Service account](directory-service-accounts.md) you configured.

This article describes the configuration changes required to allow the Defender for Identity Directory Services Account (DSA) to perform the SAM-R queries.

> [!TIP]
> While this procedure is optional, we recommend that you configure a Directory Service account and configure SAM-R for lateral movement path detection to fully secure your environment with Defender for Identity.
>

## Configure SAM-R required permissions

To ensure that Windows clients and servers allow your Defender for Identity Directory Services Account (DSA) to perform SAM-R queries, you must modify the **Group Policy** and add the DSA, in **addition to the configured accounts** listed in the **Network access** policy. Make sure to apply group policies to all computers **except domain controllers**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Perform this procedure in [*audit mode*](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-access-restrict-clients-allowed-to-make-remote-sam-calls#audit-only-mode) first, verifying the compatibility of the proposed configuration before making the changes to your production environment.
>
> Testing in audit mode is critical in ensuring that your environment remains secure, and any changes will not impact your application compatibility. You may observe increased SAM-R traffic, generated by the Defender for Identity sensors.
>

**To configure required permissions**:

1. Locate the policy. In your **Computer configuration > Windows settings > Security settings > Local policies > Security options**, select the **Network access - Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM** policy. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/samr-policy-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Network access policy selected." lightbox="../media/samr-policy-location.png":::

1. Add the DSA to the list of approved accounts able to perform this action, together with any other account that you've discovered during audit mode

For more information, see [Network access: Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-access-restrict-clients-allowed-to-make-remote-sam-calls).

## Make sure the DSA is allowed to access computers from the network (optional)

>[!NOTE]
> This procedure is only required if you've ever configured the [Access this computer from the network](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/access-this-computer-from-the-network) setting, as the [Access this computer from the network](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/access-this-computer-from-the-network) setting isn't configured by default

**To add the DSA to the list of allowed accounts**:

1. Go to the policy and navigate to **Computer Configuration** -> **Policies** -> **Windows Settings** -> **Local Policies** -> **User Right Assignment**, and select the **Access this computer from the network** setting. For example:

    ![Screenshot of the Group Policy Management Editor.](../media/access-computer-from-network.png)

1. Add the Defender for Identity Directory Service account to the list of approved accounts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When configuring user rights assignments in group policies, it's important to note that the setting *replaces* the previous one rather than adding to it. Therefore, make sure to include *all* the desired accounts in the effective group policy. By default, workstations and servers include the following accounts: Administrators, Backup Operators, Users, and Everyone
>
> The [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55319) recommends replacing the default *Everyone* with *Authenticated Users* to prevent anonymous connections from performing network sign-ins. Review your local policy settings before managing the [Access this computer from the network](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/access-this-computer-from-the-network) setting from a GPO, and consider including *Authenticated Users* in the GPO if needed.

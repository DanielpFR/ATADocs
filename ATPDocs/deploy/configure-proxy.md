# Configure endpoint proxy and internet connectivity settings for your Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor

Each Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor requires internet connectivity to the Defender for Identity cloud service to report sensor data and operate successfully. 

In some organizations, the domain controllers aren't directly connected to the internet, but are connected through a web proxy connection, and SSL inspection and intercepting proxies are not supported for security reasons.

In such cases, your proxy server must allow the data to directly pass from the Defender for Identity sensors to the relevant URLs without interception.

Use the command line, Microsoft Windows Internet (WinINet), or the registry to configure your proxy server. 

We recommend using the command line to ensure that only the Defender for Identity sensor services communicate through the proxy. When you use WinINet or the registry to configure your proxy, other services running in the context as Local System or Local Service will also direct traffic through the proxy.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft does not provide a proxy server. This article describes how to ensure that the required URLs are accessible via a proxy server that you configure.

## Configure a proxy server using the command line

Configure your proxy server during sensor installation using the following command-line switches.

### Syntax

`"Azure ATP sensor Setup.exe" [/quiet] [/Help] [ProxyUrl="http://proxy.internal.com"] [ProxyUserName="domain\proxyuser"] [ProxyUserPassword="ProxyPassword"]`

### Switch descriptions

|Name|Syntax|Mandatory for silent installation?|Description|
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|
|**ProxyUrl**|`ProxyUrl="http\://proxy.contoso.com:8080"`|No|Specifies the proxy URL and port number for the Defender for Identity sensor.|
|**ProxyUserName**|`ProxyUserName="Contoso\ProxyUser"`|No|If your proxy service requires authentication, define a user name in the `DOMAIN\user` format.|
|**ProxyUserPassword**|`ProxyUserPassword="P@ssw0rd"`|No|Specifies the password for your  proxy user name. <br><br>Credentials are encrypted and stored locally by the Defender for Identity sensor.|

> [!TIP]
> If you've configured a proxy during installation, changing the proxy configuration requires you to remove and install the sensor. Therefore, we recommend creating and using a custom DNS A record for the proxy server, which you can use to change the proxy server's address when needed.
>
> We also recommend using the *hosts* file for testing.

## Configure a proxy server using WinINet

When configuring the proxy using WinINet, keep in mind that the embedded Defender for Identity sensor service runs in system context using the **LocalService** account, and that the Defender for Identity Sensor updater service runs in the system context using **LocalSystem** account.

- If you use WinHTTP for proxy configuration, you still need to configure Windows Internet (WinINet) browser proxy settings for communication between the sensor and the Defender for Identity cloud service.

- If you're using Transparent proxy or WPAD in your network topology, you don't need to configure WinINet for your proxy.

## Configure a proxy server using the registry

This section describes how to configure a static proxy server manually using a registry-based static proxy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configuring a proxy via the registry affects all applications that use WinINet with the **LocalService** and **LocalSystem** accounts, including Windows services.
>
> Apply registry changes only to the **LocalService** and **LocalSystem** accounts.
>

To configure your proxy, copy your proxy configuration in user context to the **LocalSystem** and **LocalService** accounts as follows:

1. Back up your registry keys.

1. In the registry, search for the `DefaultConnectionSettings` value as `REG_BINARY`, under the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections\DefaultConnectionSettings` registry key, and copy it.

1. If the `LocalSystem` doesn't have the correct proxy settings, copy the proxy setting from the `Current_User` to the `LocalSystem`, under the `HKU\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections\DefaultConnectionSettings` registry key.

    Make sure to paste the value from the `Current_User`'s `DefaultConnectionSettings` registry key as `REG_BINARY`.

    This may happen if your proxy settings aren't configured, or if they're different from the `Current_User`.

1. If the `LocalService` doesn't have the correct proxy settings, then copy the proxy setting from the `Current_User` to the `LocalService`, under the `HKU\S-1-5-19\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections\DefaultConnectionSettings` registry key.

    Make sure to paste the value from the `Current_User`'s `DefaultConnectionSettings` registry key as `REG_BINARY`.


## Enable access to Defender for Identity service URLs in the proxy server

To ensure maximal security and data privacy, Defender for Identity uses certificate-based, mutual authentication between each Defender for Identity sensor and the Defender for Identity cloud back-end. SSL inspection and interception are not supported, as they interfere in the authentication process.

To enable access to Defender for Identity, make sure to allow traffic to the following URLs:

|URL  |Description  |Example  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`<your-instance-name>.atp.azure.com`     |  Console connectivity       |   `contoso-corp.atp.azure.com`      |
|`<your-instance-name>sensorapi.atp.azure.com`     | Sensor connectivity        |    `contoso-corpsensorapi.atp.azure.com`     |

The URL syntaxes listed in the table above automatically map to the correct service location for your Defender for Identity instance.

> [!TIP]
> Occasionally, the Defender for Identity service IP addresses may change. 
>
> If you manually configure IP addresses, or if your proxy automatically resolves DNS names to their IP address and uses them, we recommend that you periodically check that the configured IP addresses are still up-to-date.
>

### Enable access with a service tag

Alternately, use the IP address ranges in our **AzureAdvancedThreatProtection** Azure service tag to enable access to Defender for Identity. For more information, see [Virtual network service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview). 

To download the *Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags - Public Cloud* file, select [https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519).

For US Government offerings, see [Get started with US Government offerings](../us-govt-gcc-high.md).

## Test proxy connectivity

The Defender for Identity sensor requires network connectivity to the Defender for Identity service running in Azure. Most organizations control access to the internet via firewall or proxies.  When using a proxy, you can allow access port 443 via a single URL. For more information, see [Required ports](prerequisites.md#required-ports)

After the proxy has been configured to allow the sensor access to the Defender for Identity service, do the following steps to confirm that everything is working as expected. Perform this procedure either before you deploy the sensor, or if the sensor experiences connectivity issues after being installed.

1. Open a browser using the same proxy settings being used by the sensor.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If the proxy settings are defined for **Local System**, you'll need to use PSExec to open a session as **Local System** and open the browser from that session.

1. Go to: `https://<your_workspace_name>sensorapi.atp.azure.com`, where `<your_workspace_name>` is the name of your Defender for Identity workspace.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You *must* specify `HTTPS`, not `HTTP`, to properly test connectivity.

You should get an *Error 503 The service is unavailable* message, which indicates you were successfully able to route to the Defender for Identity HTTPS endpoint.  This is the desired result.

If you don't get an *Error 503 The service is unavailable* message, you may have a problem with your proxy configuration. Check your network and proxy settings.

If you get a certificate error, ensure that you have the required trusted root certificates installed before continuing. For more information, see [Proxy authentication problem presents as a connection error](../troubleshooting-known-issues.md#proxy-authentication-problem-presents-as-a-connection-error). 

Certificate details should look similar to the following: **DigiCert Global Root G2** > **Microsoft Azure TLS Issuing CA 01** > ***.atp.azure.com**.

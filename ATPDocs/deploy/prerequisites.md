# Microsoft Defender for Identity prerequisites

This article describes the requirements for a successful Microsoft Defender for Identity deployment. For more information, see [Defender for Identity architecture](../architecture.md).

<!--are we missing details about service BGP community from the original file?-->
## Licensing requirements

Before deploying Defender for Identity, make sure to acquire one of the following Microsoft 365 licenses:


- Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 (EMS E5/A5)
- Microsoft 365 E5 (M365 E5/A5/G5)
- Microsoft 365 E5/A5/G5 Security

Defender for Identity also supports standalone licenses.

Acquire your licenses directly via the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security-pricing) or use the Cloud Solution Partner (CSP) licensing model.

For more information, see [Licensing and privacy](/defender-for-identity/technical-faq#licensing-and-privacy).

## Required permissions

To create your Defender for Identity workspace, you'll need:

- **An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant** with at least one Global or Security administrator.

    You'll need Global or Security administrator access on your tenant to access the **Identity** section of the Microsoft 365 Defender **Settings** area and create the workspace.

    For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity role groups](role-groups.md).

- **At least one Directory Service account** with read access to all objects in the monitored domains. For more information, see [Configure a Directory Service account for Microsoft Defender for Identity](directory-service-accounts.md).

## Connectivity requirements

The Defender for Identity sensor must be able to communicate with the Defender for Identity cloud service, using one of the following methods:

|Method  |Description  |Considerations |Learn more |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Set up a proxy**     | Customers who have a forward proxy deployed can take advantage of the proxy to provide connectivity to the MDI cloud service.  <br><br> If you choose this option, you'll configure your proxy later in the deployment process.       |  Allows access to the internet for a single URL  <br><br>SSL inspection isn't supported      |    [Configure endpoint proxy and internet connectivity settings](configure-proxy.md)    |
|**ExpressRoute**     | ExpressRoute can be configured to forward MDI sensor traffic over customer’s express route. <br><br> To route network traffic destined to the Defender for Identity cloud servers use ExpressRoute Microsoft peering and add the Microsoft Defender for Identity (12076:5220) service BGP community to your route filter.    |  Requires ExpressRoute.       |       [Service to BGP community value](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing#service-to-bgp-community-value)  |
|**Firewall, using the Defender for Identity Azure IP addresses**     | Customers who don’t have a proxy or ExpressRoute can configure their firewall with the IP addresses assigned to the MDI cloud service. This requires that the customer monitor the Azure IP address list for any changes in the IP addresses used by the MDI cloud service.  <br><br> If you chose this option, we recommend that you download the [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags – Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519) file and use the **AzureAdvancedThreatProtection** service tag add the relevant IP addresses.      |  Customer must monitor Azure IP assignments       |   [Virtual network service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview)      |

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Identity architecture](../architecture.md) and [Configure endpoint proxy and internet connectivity settings](configure-proxy.md).

## Required network adapters

The Defender for Identity sensor monitors local traffic on all of the domain controller's network adapters. After deployment, you'll use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to modify which network adapters are monitored.

<!-- removing this as per Gershon: If you install the Defender for Identity sensor on a machine configured with a NIC teaming adapter and the Winpcap driver, you'll receive an installation error.

To install the Defender for Identity sensor on a machine configured with NIC teaming, make sure you replace the Winpcap driver with Npcap. For more information, see [How do I download and install or upgrade the Npcap driver?](../technical-faq.yml#how-do-i-download-and-install-or-upgrade-the-npcap-driver)-->

## Sensor requirements

The following table summarizes requirements for the domain controller server where you'll install the Defender for Identity sensor.

| Prerequisite / Recommendation |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Specifications**     |  Make sure to install Defender for Identity on Windows version 2012 or higher, on a domain controller server with a minimum of:<br><br>- 2 cores<br>- 6 GB of RAM<br>- 6 GB of disk space required, 10 GB recommended, including space for Defender for Identity binaries and logs <br><br>Defender for Identity supports read-only domain controllers (RODC).     |
|**Performance**   | For optimal performance, set the **Power Option** of the machine running the Defender for Identity sensor to **High Performance**.        |
|**Maintenance window**     |   We recommend scheduling a maintenance window for your domain controllers, as a restart might be required if the installation runs and a restart is already pending, or if .NET Framework needs to be installed. <br><br>If .NET Framework version 4.7 or later isn't already found on the system, .NET Framework version 4.7 is installed, and may require a restart.      |

### Minimum operating system requirements

The following table lists installation support across several operating system versions:

| Operating system version | Server with Desktop Experience | Server Core | Nano Server | Supported installations|
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Windows Server  2012 [<sup>1</sup>](#eos) [<sup>2</sup></sup>](#mpg)        | ✔     | ✔    | Not  applicable    | Domain  controller       |
| Windows Server  2012 R2 [<sup>1</sup>](#eos)     | ✔   | ✔       | Not  applicable      | Domain  controller  |

<a name="eos"></a><sup>1</sup> Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 will reach extended end of support on **October 10, 2023**. We recommend that you plan to upgrade those servers by that point, as Microsoft will no longer support the Defender for Identity sensor on devices running Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2.

<a name="mpg"></a><sup>2</sup> For Windows Server 2012, the Defender for Identity sensor isn't supported in a [Multi Processor Group mode](/windows/win32/procthread/processor-groups). For more information, see [Multi Processor Group mode troubleshooting](../troubleshooting-known-issues.md#multi-processor-group-mode).

<a name="kb"></a><sup>3</sup> Requires [KB4487044](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/february-12-2019-kb4487044-os-build-17763-316-6502eb5d-dde8-6902-e149-27ef359ed616) or a newer cumulative update. Sensors installed on Server 2019 without this update will be automatically stopped if the *ntdsai.dll* file version found in the system directory is older than *10.0.17763.316*.

### Required ports

<a name=connectivity></a><sup>1</sup> Connectivity from the sensor to the Defender for Identity cloud services is required either directly on port 443, or through a proxy. For more information, see [Configuring a proxy for Defender for Identity](configure-proxy.md).

<a name=localhost></a><sup>2</sup> By default, localhost to localhost traffic is allowed unless a custom firewall policy blocks it.

<a name=nnr></a><sup>3</sup> One of these ports is required, but we recommend opening all of them.

### Dynamic memory requirements

The following table describes memory requirements on the server used for the Defender for Identity sensor, depending on the type of virtualization you're using:

|VM running on|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|**Hyper-V**|Ensure that **Enable Dynamic Memory** isn't enabled for the VM.|
|**VMware**|Ensure that the amount of memory configured and the reserved memory are the same, or select the **Reserve all guest memory (All locked)** option in the VM settings.|
|**Other virtualization host**|Refer to the vendor supplied documentation on how to ensure that memory is fully allocated to the VM at all times. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running as a virtual machine, all memory must be allocated to the virtual machine at all times.

## Time synchronization
The servers and domain controllers onto which the sensor is installed must have time synchronized to within five minutes of each other.

# Deploy Microsoft Defender for Identity with Microsoft 365 Defender

This article provides an overview of the full deployment process for Microsoft Defender for Identity, including steps for preparation, deployment, and extra steps for specific scenarios.

Defender for Identity is a primary component of a [Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) strategy and your XDR deployment with Microsoft 365 Defender. Defender for Identity uses Active Directory signals to detect sudden account changes like privilege escalation or high-risk lateral movement, and reports on easily exploited identity issues like unconstrained Kerberos delegation, for correction by the security team.

For a quick set of deployment highlights, see [Quick installation guide](quick-installation-guide.md).

## Start using Microsoft 365 Defender

This section describes how to start onboarding to Defender for Identity.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). 
1. From the navigation menu, select any item, such as **Incidents & alerts**, **Hunting**, **Action center**, or **Threat analytics** to initiate the onboarding process.

You'll then be given the option to deploy supported services, including Microsoft Defender for Identity. Cloud components required for Defender for Identity are automatically added when you open the Defender for Identity settings page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, Defender for Identity data centers are deployed in Europe, UK, North America/Central America/Caribbean, Australia East, and Asia. Your instance is created automatically in the Azure region closest to the geographical location of your Azure Active Directory tenant. Once created, Defender for Identity instances aren't movable.

## Preparation

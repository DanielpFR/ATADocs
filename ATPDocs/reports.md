# Download and schedule Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft 365 Defender

The Microsoft 365 Defender includes Defender for Identity reports. Use the **Reports management** page to either generate a report on demand, or configure Microsoft 365 Defender to send you a report periodically by email.

## Access Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft 365 Defender

To access Defender for Identity reports in Microsoft 365 Defender, select **Settings > Identities > Reports management**.

Available reports include:

|Report name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Summary**| Presents a dashboard of your system status, including: <br><br>- **Summary**: A summary of detected network activity <br>- **Open suspicious activities**: Lists the suspicious activities you should take care of <br>- **Open health issues**: Lists Defender for Identity health issues you should take care of. <br><br> Suspicious activities and health issues are listed by type. |
|**Modification to sensitive groups**     |    Lists every time a modification is made to sensitive groups, such as admins, or manually tagged accounts or groups. If you're using Defender for Identity standalone sensors, make sure that [events are forwarded from your domain controllers to the standalone sensors](configure-event-forwarding.md) in order to receive a full report about your sensitive groups.     |
|**Passwords exposed in cleartext**     | Lists all source computer and account passwords detected by Defender for Identity being sent in clear text. <br><br>**Note**: Some services use the LDAP non-secure protocol to send account credentials in plain text. This can even happen for sensitive accounts. Attackers monitoring network traffic can catch and then reuse these credentials for malicious purposes.     |
| **Lateral movement paths to sensitive accounts** | Lists the sensitive accounts that are exposed via lateral movement paths, for the selected report period. For more information, see [Lateral movement paths](/defender-for-identity/classic-use-case-lateral-movement-path). |
